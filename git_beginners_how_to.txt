Hello all,
This is a very basic "how to" on git.
You will be able to synchonize a repository with the online one at github.

Use linux ( I am using Ubuntu)
Download git to your computer.

Step1: make a directory (eg. "/home/../../git") somewhere in your computer where you download your online repos from git.
Step2: Move to that directory and download the repo of your interest to this directory .
	Eg. Lets say that you already have a repository called "welcome" and let it have 2 files namely "1.txt" and "2.txt".
	Now you will download this repo named "welcome" into the your directory called "/home/../../git" under the same name. The new directory would look like "/home/../../git/welcome" and this will contain your files "1.txt" and "2.txt"
	The git command that you will use is this
	git clone git://github.com/<username>/<name of your online repo, "welcome" in this case>
Step2: initialize this directory into a git repo locally.
	The git command "git init" will do all the house keeping functions for making this directory into a local git repository.
Step3: Editing the files of your interest.
Step4: Add all this files to the staging area. 
	The git command 
	git add *           -> to add all files

Step5: Tell who you are to your git
	The following git commands will do it
	git config --global user.email "<your email add>"
	git config --global user.name "<your github username>"
Step6: only if you tell who you are to your local git you will be able to commit (save your latest changes) to your files
	The git command 
	git commit
Step7: Reflect all these changes to your online repository.
	Beware you should have a online repository( you entirely cannot make a repository locally and then push it to github)
	The git command
	git push origin master
	
	Here you will be promted for the github's username and password
